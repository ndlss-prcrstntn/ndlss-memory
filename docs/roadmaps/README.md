# Roadmaps

Versioned roadmap snapshots live here.

- `0.2.0.md` - baseline roadmap snapshot promoted to the `0.2.0` release.

Usage:

- treat each file as the source of truth for that release scope;
- add a new file for each next milestone (for example `0.3.0.md`);
- do not rewrite old roadmap files after release, only append clarifications.
